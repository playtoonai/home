    <h4 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Sales Agreement</h4>
    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Purchased Offerings</h5>
    <p>Certain Products accessible through this Application as part of the Service are offered on a payment
      basis. The fees, duration, and conditions applicable to the acquisition of such Products are
      delineated below and in the specified sections of this Application.
    </p>
    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Product Summary</h5>
    <p>Prices, descriptions, or availability of Products are detailed in their respective sections on this
      Application and are subject to alteration without prior notice. Although Products on this
      Application are presented with the utmost technical accuracy feasible, their representation
      (including graphical material, images, colors, sounds, if applicable) is solely for reference and
      does not guarantee the characteristics of the purchased Product. The specific attributes of the
      chosen Product will be elucidated throughout the purchasing process.
    </p>
    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Purchasing process</h5>
    <p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process. The
      purchasing process includes these steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      You must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.
      After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, You may place the order
      by submitting it.
      Order submission
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Upon placing an order, the following conditions are applicable:</b>
      The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for You the
      obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the purchased Product requires active input from You, such as the provision of personal
      information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation
      for You to cooperate accordingly.
      Upon submission of the order, You will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Prices</b>
      You are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes
      and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged. Prices on this Application
      are displayed in excluding any applicable fees, taxes and costs.

    </p>
    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Payment Options</h5>
    <p>Accepted payment methods are disclosed during the purchasing process. Some payment methods might be
      subject to additional conditions or fees, which can be found in the dedicated section of this
      Application. All payments are handled through third-party services. Therefore, this Application
      doesn't collect payment details like credit card information; it solely receives a notification
      post-successful payment completion. Should a payment fail or be declined by the service provider, we
      are not obliged to fulfill the purchase order. Any resulting costs or fees due to failed or refused
      payments are your responsibility.</p>

    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Retention of Usage Rights</h5>

    <h4 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Contract Duration</h4>
    <b>One-Time Purchase</b>
    <p>Making a one-time purchase offers you the opportunity to acquire a product without the commitment of
      a recurring subscription. The transaction is complete upon receipt of payment, providing you with
      immediate access to the product. Unlike subscriptions, there is no need for ongoing payments, giving
      you the flexibility to make a single, upfront purchase. Enjoy the product without the obligation of
      regular fees or the risk of service interruptions.</p>
    <b>Subscriptions</b>
    <p>Subscriptions enable continuous or regular receipt of a Product over a set period. Paid
      subscriptions begin upon our receipt of payment. To maintain subscriptions, timely payment of the
      recurring fee is necessary. Failure to comply may lead to service interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Fixed-Term Subscriptions</b>
      Paid fixed-term subscriptions start upon our receipt of payment and last for the chosen subscription
      period. Once expired, access to the Product ends unless you renew by paying the relevant fee.
      Fixed-term subscriptions cannot be terminated prematurely and expire at the end of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Automatic Renewal</b>
      Subscriptions automatically renew via the chosen payment method unless canceled within the specified
      termination deadlines in the Terms or this Application. Renewals match the original term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Termination</b>
      Recurring subscriptions can be terminated at any time by sending a clear notice to us through
      provided contact details or via controls within this Application.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Termination Notice</b>
      Termination takes effect after the current period if notice is received before renewal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Termination of Open-Ended</b>
      Subscriptions Open-ended subscriptions can be terminated by providing clear notice. Termination
      takes effect 7 days after receipt of the termination notice.
    </p>

    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">User Rights</h5>
    <p><b>Right of Withdrawal</b>
      Subject to conditions, you may withdraw from the contract within the specified period (usually 14
      days) without justification. Details about withdrawal conditions are provided in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Who Can Exercise the Right of Withdrawal</b>
      European Consumers generally have the statutory right to withdraw from online contracts within the
      specified period, except under applicable exceptions. If you don’t meet this criterion, you cannot
      benefit from this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exercising the Right of Withdrawal</b>
      To withdraw, it's essential to provide a clear statement of your intention. You can use the provided
      withdrawal form or express your intention in any appropriate way within the withdrawal period. Make
      sure the withdrawal notice is sent before the deadline expires. In order to exercise your right of
      withdrawal, you must send an unambiguous statement expressing your intention to withdraw from the
      contract. You can utilize the model withdrawal form available in the "definitions" section of this
      Policy. Alternatively, you're free to clearly convey your intention to withdraw through any suitable
      means. Ensure the withdrawal notice is sent before the withdrawal period lapses to meet the deadline
      for exercising this right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>When does the deadline for withdrawal lapse?</b>
      For the purchase of a service, the withdrawal period ends 14 days after entering into the contract,
      unless you have waived the withdrawal right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Consequences of opting out</b>
      Upon correct withdrawal from a contract, you'll be reimbursed for all payments made, including any
      covering delivery costs, if applicable. However, additional costs incurred due to selecting a
      delivery method other than the least expensive standard delivery offered by us will not be
      reimbursed. This reimbursement will be prompt, no later than 14 days from when we are notified of
      your decision to withdraw. Unless agreed otherwise, reimbursements will use the same payment method
      as the initial transaction. You won't bear any costs associated with this reimbursement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Concerning Service Acquisitions,</b>
      If you exercise the right of withdrawal after requesting service commencement before the withdrawal
      period ends, you'll owe an amount proportional to the service provided. This payment is calculated
      based on the agreed fee and the service portion rendered until your withdrawal compared to the full
      coverage of the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exclusions to the withdrawal entitlement</b>
      Services have been entirely performed, provided the consumer gave prior express consent, and
      acknowledged that their right of withdrawal is forfeited once the contract is completed.
    </p>

    <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: #78727f;">Responsibility and Compensation</h5>
    <p>- For EU Users, there are limits to withdrawal rights for services fully performed with prior consent
      that acknowledges the loss of withdrawal rights upon completion. There's also limited liability for
      certain damages under applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Australian Users retain non-excludable rights regarding service performance, while US Users are
      provided the Service 'as is', disclaiming warranties and limiting liability. Both agree to indemnify
      the service provider from claims related to use and access, adhering to certain common provisions.
    </p>
    <p>

      patents, and design rights, belong exclusively to us or our licensors. These rights are protected by

      changes. These modifications will only impact future interactions between you and us. By continuing

      applicable law, we will specify the effective date of the modified Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Contract Handover</b>

      extent necessary to make it valid and consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute
      the entire Agreement, superseding all prior communications between the parties regarding the subject
      matter, and will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>For EU Users:</b>
      Should any provision be void, invalid, or unenforceable, efforts will be made to mutually agree on
      valid replacements. Failing this, void or invalid provisions will be substituted by applicable
      statutory provisions if ,permitted by law.

      The nullity or invalidity of a specific provision will not void the entire Agreement, unless that
      provision is fundamental or crucial to the Agreement. In such cases, or if the remaining provisions
      would impose unacceptable hardship on any party, the contract might be voided.

    </p>
